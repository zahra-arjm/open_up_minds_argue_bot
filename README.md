Analysis of wizards and argumentative bot conversation effectiveness in opening up minds

This project is part of a bigger project called opening up minds. In this project, the research team tired to generate arguments to open up minds about the views of other people in opposing group, regarding contraversial topics, such as vaccination, brexit, and GMO foods. For more information see [this](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.335.pdf) paper.

The data I used for this project consisted of the dialougues between the trained assistants (called wizards) or the generative argument robot (called argue bot) and participants. However, the data is not publicly available yet. So, only the codes can be found on this repo so far.
I was supposed to check if the wizards and the bot have followed the conversation rules (such as not negating the participants opinion by starting with "No", or using some words to show that you have listend to the other person). In addidtion to that, I had to check if following conversation rules had actually resulted to "opening up minds". I have used data exploration and visualization techniques to analyze the data.
